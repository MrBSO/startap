#Platform for sharing learning materials and knowledge among students
Every student has a large number of groups in messengers, and a huge number of various photos and screenshots, with which it is inconvenient to work.In addition, very often in the course of solving tasks arise some problems that need to be quickly solved.Most often you need the help of someone who understands the problem, but among the classmates may not be available or ready to help.What to do then? The answer is simple: you need a place to communicate people interested in solving a particular problem.This is where this platform comes into play, which brings people together,
#Interface functions
It will be possible to create separate groups for specific topics and questions.Users can create a group for solving some laboratory work, and since it is difficult for people to navigate through the huge flow of information, the group creator will be given the opportunity to post messages and screenshots/photos that he/she considers important, to facilitate the process of understanding any of the work
Example: A group has been created to solve 3 OAiP labs. Over 50 people have joined this group. It will be very inconvenient to navigate through the huge amount of information, so as we work together to solve the work, the group creator will be able to post the conditions of the task, as well as certain messages and screenshots/photos that will be useful for understanding the solution.
This way it will be much easier for new users to understand all the information.
