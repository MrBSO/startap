1.Subject area:for the convenience and optimization of movement of any person
Problem:It is quite inconvenient to choose both the airline ticket, the hotel, and the way to get there. There are individual websites or airlines that will offer everything either separately, or one has to pay dearly for the services. However, big cities can also have a transportation problem, especially for commuters. 
The way to solve:A website or program that allows you to go all the way from your home to your destination at once, offering comparisons and information about each method. You can leave the house, living in a big city, and set the goal to get to the other side of the same city, or to a neighboring country, it does not matter. The program will select routes, and calculate the approximate time and financial costs. In addition, in a big city there may be traffic jams, so the program can immediately show that the trip on the ground can be delayed and that it will be faster in the subway, and so on. It will be possible to set settings, for example, to wait for a cab at the exit from the subway (if it is necessary), or to select hotels by criteria, for example, buffet.
